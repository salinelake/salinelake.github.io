I'm an [Alvarez Postdoctoral Fellow](https://cs.lbl.gov/careers/computing-fellowships/alvarez-fellowship/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I received my PhD in Applied Math from the [Program of Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, where I was advised by Roberto Car and Weinan E. 
You can find the complete list of my publications at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WreiKioAAAAJ&hl=en), and my Curriculum Vitae [here](/about/).
 

## Research Summary
The central goal of my work is to consistently bridge physical models at different scales. This is similar to drawing “the bull” at different stages of abstraction.

See [here](/research/) for details.

## News
`Jan 2025` I open-sourced the Python package [OpenFerro](https://github.com/salinelake/OpenFerro). A numerical framework for on-lattice atomistic dynamics simulation, supporting auto-differentiation and multi-physics simulation.

`Oct 2024`  &nbsp; Our paper ``Deuteration removes quantum dipolar defects from KDP crystals'' is published at [npj Computational Materials](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-024-01431-2).

`Sept 2024` &nbsp; Coarse-Graining Conformational Dynamics with Multidimensional Generalized Langevin Equation: [How, When, and Why](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00729)

`Apr 2024` &nbsp; Our paper ``Deuteration removes quantum dipolar defects from KDP crystals'' appears on Arxiv! ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08125)). State-of-the-art path-integral MD simulation brings new stories of materials that have been intensively studied but never fully understood.

`Mar 2024` &nbsp; Our paper ``Ab Initio generalized Langevin equation'' is published by PNAS ([link](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2308668121)). 

`Mar 2024` &nbsp; I give a talk on ab initio generalized langevin equation (AIGLE) in 2024 APS March Meeting at Minneapolis. 

## Open-Source Statement
I advocate data and code sharing for all research works supported by non-profit grants and funding. I try my best to upload code, data, models, and even post-processing scripts to Github or permanent repos like Zenodo after the conclusion of a project. It is the responsibility of our generation to reduce statements like "** available upon reasonable requests" in publications. 

## Software Development
[**OpenFerro**](https://github.com/salinelake/OpenFerro): Python package designed to minimize the effort required to build on-lattice Hamiltonian models, and to perform molecular dynamics (MD) and Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations.

[**AIGLETools**](https://github.com/salinelake/AIGLETools): Python package designed to minimize the effort required to build ab initio generalized Langevin equation (AIGLE) & ab initio Langevin equation (AILE) models for multi-dimensional time series data.
