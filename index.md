I'm an [Alvarez Postdoctoral Fellow](https://cs.lbl.gov/careers/computing-fellowships/alvarez-fellowship/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I received my PhD in Applied Math from the [Program of Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, where I was advised by Roberto Car and Weinan E. 
You can find the complete list of my publications at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WreiKioAAAAJ&hl=en), and my Curriculum Vitae [here](/about/).
 

## Research Summary
The central goal of my work is to consistently bridge physical models at different scales. This is similar to drawing “the bull” at different stages of abstraction.

See [here](/research/) for details.

## News
`Apr 2024` &nbsp; Our paper ``Deuteration removes quantum dipolar defects from KDP crystals'' appears on Arxiv! ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08125)). State-of-the-art path-integral MD simulation brings new stories of materials that have been intensively studied but never fully understood.

`Mar 2024` &nbsp; Our paper ``Ab Initio generalized Langevin equation'' is published by PNAS ([link](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2308668121)). 

`Mar 2024` &nbsp; I give a talk on ab initio generalized langevin equation (AIGLE) in 2024 APS March Meeting at Minneapolis.
