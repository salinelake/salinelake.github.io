I'm a graduate student in the [Program of Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/) of Princeton University. I will join [Lawrence Berkeley Lab](https://cs.lbl.gov/) as an Alvarez fellow in Oct. 2024.
You can find the complete list of my publication at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WreiKioAAAAJ&hl=en), and my Curriculum Vitae at [About](/about/).
 

The central goal of my work is to consistently bridge physical models at different scales. See [here](/research/) for details.
