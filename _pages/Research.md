__*Multiscale modeling*__

My main interest is developing methodology for data-driven bottom-up / ab initio multi-scale modeling. I'm interested in applying such approaches to hard condensed matters (mainly weakly-correlated systems) and soft matters (polymer, proteins, ...). 

The figure below is an overview of physical processes happening on different scales and the corresponding descriptive models. For example, for non-relativistic quantum systems, the dynamical model is the Schrodinger equation.

In principle, the other dynamical models (e.g. inter-atomic force field models) on higher scales can be derived from Schrodinger equation. In recent years, the development of machine learning allows us to explore this possibility. Now for many realistic materials, we are able to extract accurate atomistic models from quantum mechanical data, with appoaches like DeepMD. 

Based on accurate atomistic models, one can further derive coarse-grained models describing the dynamics of collective variables defined on atomistic degrees of freedom. I developped a numerical framework, ab-initio generalized Langevin equation (AIGLE), for achieving this goal.

__*Ferroeletric material*__

I am interested in modeling ferroelectric materials in terms of phase transition, domain motion and quantum effects, etc.
